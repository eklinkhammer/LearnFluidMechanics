# LearnFluidMechanics
This repo is my effort to learn Fluid Dynamics through coding. CodeToLearn is my idea that the process of defining types and writing equations - including solvers for common problems, can aid in the learning process.

# Learning Resources
This will follow along with 16.01 Unified Engineering: Fluid Mechanics from MIT's OCW
